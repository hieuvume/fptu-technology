                  My hero when I was a kid was my mom. Same for everyone I knew.
                  Moms are untouchable. They’re elegant, smart, beautiful,
                  kind…everything we want to be. At 29 years old, my favorite
                  compliment is being told that I look like my mom. Seeing myself
                  in her image, like this daughter up top, makes me so proud of
                  how far I’ve come, and so thankful for where I come from. the
                  refractor telescope uses a convex lens to focus the light on the
                  eyepiece. The reflector telescope has a concave lens which means
                  it bends in. It uses mirrors to focus the image that you
                  eventually see. Collimation is a term for how well tuned the
                  telescope is to give you a good clear image of what you are
                  looking at. You want your telescope to have good collimation so
                  you are not getting a false image of the celestial body.
                  Aperture is a fancy word for how big the lens of your telescope
                  is. But it’s an important word because the aperture of the lens
                  is the key to how powerful your telescope is. Magnification has
                  nothing to do with it, its all in the aperture. Focuser is the
                  housing that keeps the eyepiece of the telescope, or what you
                  will look through, in place. The focuser has to be stable and in
                  good repair for you to have an image you can rely on. Mount and
                  Wedge. Both of these terms refer to the tripod your telescope
                  sits on. The mount is the actual tripod and the wedge is the
                  device that lets you attach the telescope to the mount. Moms are
                  like…buttons? Moms are like glue. Moms are like pizza crusts.
                  Moms are the ones who make sure things happen—from birth to
                  school lunch.
