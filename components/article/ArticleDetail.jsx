                    My hero when I was a kid was my mom. Same for everyone I
                    knew. Moms are untouchable. They’re elegant, smart,
                    beautiful, kind…everything we want to be. At 29 years old,
                    my favorite compliment is being told that I look like my
                    mom. Seeing myself in her image, like this daughter up top,
                    makes me so proud of how far I’ve come, and so thankful for
                    where I come from. the refractor telescope uses a convex
                    lens to focus the light on the eyepiece. The reflector
                    telescope has a concave lens which means it bends in. It
                    uses mirrors to focus the image that you eventually see.
                    Collimation is a term for how well tuned the telescope is to
                    give you a good clear image of what you are looking at. You
                    want your telescope to have good collimation so you are not
                    getting a false image of the celestial body. Aperture is a
                    fancy word for how big the lens of your telescope is. But
                    it’s an important word because the aperture of the lens is
                    the key to how powerful your telescope is. Magnification has
                    nothing to do with it, its all in the aperture. Focuser is
                    the housing that keeps the eyepiece of the telescope, or
                    what you will look through, in place. The focuser has to be
                    stable and in good repair for you to have an image you can
                    rely on. Mount and Wedge. Both of these terms refer to the
                    tripod your telescope sits on. The mount is the actual
                    tripod and the wedge is the device that lets you attach the
                    telescope to the mount. Moms are like…buttons? Moms are like
